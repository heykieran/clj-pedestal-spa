# About

This version of the repository is a basic ReFrame/Reagent SPA which interacts with a Pedestal backend. An extended description can be found in a blog post [here][related-blog-post].

Later versions will build upon this, adding greater capabilities, such as docker deployment, other authentication methods (i.e jwt and IAP), deployment to Kubernetes, and server-to-client communication using web sockets and SSE.
