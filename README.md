# About

In this version of the repository I show two different ways of communicating _status_ messages from the server to the client where they are displayed in the SPA's UI. These messages might be updates about a long-running process initiated by the user, or even general server state messages broadcast by the server to some, or all, clients. 

I show how to use web both sockets and SSE (server sent events).

A more detailed discussion can be found in this [blog post][related-blog-post].
