# About

In previous [blog post][old-blog-post] I discussed how to deploy a full-stack Clojure application as a Docker container. 

In this version of the repository I integrate the build process within the repo itself, so the back-end application, the front-end SPA, and the build process are self contained.

A full discussion of this version can be found in this [blog post][related-blog-post].
